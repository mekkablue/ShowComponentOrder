# ShowComponentOrder.glyphsReporter

This is a plugin for the [Glyphs font editor](http://glyphsapp.com/) by Georg Seifert.
It displays components in different colors depending on the order of the component. This way, you can step through your component-based glyphs (fn-arrows or Home/End on large keyboards) and quickly spot an order mistake.
After installation, it will add the menu item *View > Show Component Order*.
You can set a keyboard shortcut in System Preferences.
